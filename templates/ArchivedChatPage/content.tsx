                                I see the image! 📷 It looks like a system of
                                linear equations with 4 variables
                                x1,x2,x3,x4x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4x1​,x2​,x3​,x4​.
                                The flow usually goes like this:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Write the equations in matrix form.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Choose a method (substitution, elimination,
                                    or matrix/row reduction).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Solve step by step until you isolate each
                                    variable.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
